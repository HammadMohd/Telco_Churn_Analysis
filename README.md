# Telco_Churn_Analysis

# Customer Churn Analysis for a Telecommunications Company
# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn within a telecommunications company and identifying key drivers of churn. By segmenting customers based on various characteristics, such as tenure and monthly charges, we aim to uncover patterns that influence churn. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights and strategies to help reduce churn and improve customer retention.

# Key Tasks
# Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Goal: Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

Actions:

Calculate and visualize the overall churn rate.

Explore customer distribution by demographics such as gender, age, and geography.

Analyze tenure distribution and investigate relationships between churn and contract types/payment methods.

# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Goal: Perform exploratory analysis to uncover patterns in the data.

Actions:

Segment customers based on key factors like tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.

Analyze churn rates within different customer segments to identify high-risk groups.

# Task 3: Customer Segmentation
Goal: Segment customers into meaningful groups based on attributes and behavior.

Actions:

Create customer segments based on tenure, contract type, payment method, and monthly charges.

Analyze customer behavior and churn rates across segments.

# Task 4: Data Visualization
Goal: Use visualizations to gain deeper insights into customer behavior and churn patterns.

Actions:

Create box plots, violin plots, and pair plots to explore customer distributions and relationships between key features.

Visualize churn rates across different customer segments.
